### Hello ðŸ‘‹

<!-- Introduce yourself and give a brief introduction about yourself here.  Also include what tech you're interested in and what you are currently learning -->
### My name is Miebi and I am currently transitioning into tech as a Cloud/DevOps Engineer. I have a mechanical engineering degree but have always been fascinated/interested in working in tech in some capacity. At various points during college, I dabbled with learning how to code but never fully committed until after college. I have worked as a Project Engineer and Production Engineer in the oil & gas and manufacturing industries and have gained valuable skills in time management, leadership, root cause analysis, troubleshooting, Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) creation, and much more that will be valuable in any field.

### As of August 2023, I am enrolled in a 24-week Cloud/DevOps Engineering boot camp with Level Up In Tech. I am gaining and developing skills in AWS, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation), Python, Docker, and much more.
